## My process

### Built with

* Semantic HTML5 markup
* CSS custom properties
* Flexbox
* CSS Grid
* Mobile-first workflow
* Git & GitHub for version control

### What I learned

While building this project, I learned how to:

* Set up a responsive layout for multiple screen sizes using media queries
* Create consistent spacing using utility CSS classes
* Use semantic HTML for better accessibility and structure
* Structure image assets across desktop, tablet, and mobile views without duplication

```html
<section class="feature">
  <img src="assets/desktop/image-keyboard.jpg" alt="Mechanical keyboard">
</section>
```

```css
.feature {
  display: grid;
  gap: 2rem;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to keep improving in:

* CSS Grid mastery for complex layouts
* Accessibility best practices
* Project structure and scalability

### Useful resources

* [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - For solid HTML/CSS references
* [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) - For practical challenges
